# About
A homework collection for my server programming course done in the Spring of 2020.
During this course we learned about the Spring Framework. This repo also hosts a small project that went on through the whole course. It is a bookstore with CRUD functionalities. Each week we added more and more functionalities to it.

## Future
Altough this was a course done in the Spring of 2020, i do intend to run over thisn course again. There will not be anything new to display, just another iteration of me doing the assignments.
I plan on doing this i March 2021.
